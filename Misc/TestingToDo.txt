1. find best parameters for each dataset (function that takes in dataset, maybe component model)
2. Run each component model using a few best-parameter sets (function that takes in component model and dataset)
3. Run each ensemble model on each dataset (function tht takes in ensemble model and dataset)
3. Look at accuracy, confusion matrix (by race? do this by training on whole dataset, analyzing on datasets
   split by race), error diversity (pairwise compare agreement/disagreement between component models when wrong)

4. Confidence/probability given input vector for each model on each dataset
5. (low priority) use charge ID more intelligently
